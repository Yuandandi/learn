1. What do props help us accomplish?
make a component more reusable.

2. How do you pass a prop into a component?
<MyAwesomeHeader title='???' />

3. can i passs a custom prop? e.g. <div blabla={true}> 
no, because the jsx we use to describe native DOM elements will be turned into
real DOM elements by react. and real DOM elements  only have the
properties/attributes specified in the HTML specification. (which doesn't
include properties like blabla)

3. how do I receive props in component?
``` jsx
function Navbar(props) { // It could be props or Whatever but conventionally people use "props"
    console.log(props.blabla)
        return (
                <header>
                ...
                <header>
               )
}
```
