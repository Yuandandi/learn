1. How would you describe the concept of "state"?
mutable, meaning you need to change the value, in some case user will define the
value and you can't reassign the user value input. a way for react to remember
saved values from within a component. this is similar to declaring variables
from within a component, with a few add bonuses

2. When would you want to use props instead of state?
anytime you want to pass data into a component so that component cn determine
What will get displayed on the screen.

3. When would you want to use state instead of props?
anytime you want to a component to maintain some values from within component.
(and "remember" those values even When react re-renders the component)

4. What does "immutable" mean? are props immutable? is state immutable?
unchanging. props are immutable (the code will not break) but you give no
meaning to changing user input. state is mutable ; we do plan on changing state
