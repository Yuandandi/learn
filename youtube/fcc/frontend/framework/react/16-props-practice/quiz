1. What does the .map() array method do?
looping through each item. returns a new array. whatever gets returnd from the
callback function provided is placed at the same index in the new array. usually
we take the items form the original array and modify them in some way

2. What do we usuallly use `.map()` for in react
looping through an array. convert an array of raw data into an array of jsx
elements that can be displayed on the page.

3. why is Using `.map()` better than just creating the components manyally by
typing them out?
take so much time and, It is not reuseable for example if you want to add or
remove item from an array, It will give you dynamically workflow. makes our code
more "self-sustainin" - not requiring addictional changes whenever the data
changes
