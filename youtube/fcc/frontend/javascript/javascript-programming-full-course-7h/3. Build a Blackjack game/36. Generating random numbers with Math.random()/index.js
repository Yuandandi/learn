What does Math.random() do?

Your answer: 

// The Math.random() function in JavaScript generates a floating-point, pseudo-random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). This means:

// The number generated can be as low as 0, but it will never actually be 0.
// The number generated will be less than 1, but it will never be exactly 1.

// In other words, Math.random() can return a value that is 0 but never exactly 1. The range is mathematically described as [0, 1).;
