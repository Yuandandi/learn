var a; // assigning variable (not declaring). best practice to have semicolon at the end but You can run without It too
console.log(a); // null (undefined)
var b = 2; // declaring and assigning at one line. declaring b and assigning 2(number) at variable b

a = 7; // assign 7 to a. we don't need to declare because have been declared on top

console.log(a); // 7
