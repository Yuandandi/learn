es2016 will use let
es5 will use var

rootdir ; your main ts Directory
outdir ; your compiled ts to js Directory

add this into config in the end of the line
if you add a new file in root It won't compiled
"include": [
    "src"
]

tsc --noEmitOnError -w ; will override the config

strongly typed languages ; demand the specification of types
ts is strongly typed language 

loosely typed languages ; do not require type specification
js is loosely typed languages / weakly typed languages 

static typing and dynamic type is not related with strong type or loosely type

a language that is strongly typed can be eitehr statically or dynamically typed

ts is statically typed language ; types are checked at 'compile' time
js is dynamically typed language ; types are checked at 'run' time

ts benefits ; 
- self-documenting
- catch errors in dev!
- great for teams
